## CS_370_Current-Emerging_Trends_in_CS
Culmination and refleciton of work for the SNHU CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science course which focused on Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
I was provided with a skeleton codebase that included the core game environment, represented as a maze, and some rudimentary AI agent functionalities. I developed the machine learning model, specifically the deep Q-learning algorithm using neural networks, to allow the agent to learn how to navigate through the maze and find the treasure. My code included data preprocessing, model training, and the implementation of the epsilon-greedy policy for action selection.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop algorithms, data structures, and software solutions that power the digital world. Their work matters because it drives advancements in almost every field, from healthcare and education to finance and transportation.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I start by analyzing the problem to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. I then identify the algorithms, data structures or other potential solutions best suited for each task. Prototyping and iterative improvement, often leveraging existing libraries and tools, allow me to develop the most appropriate solution. Finally, rigorous testing ensures the solution's effectiveness and robustness.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethically, I'm responsible for ensuring that my software is secure, reliable, and user-friendly. It should not harm the end-user or compromise their data. To the organization, I owe due diligence in delivering well-documented, maintainable code that meets the project requirements. In both cases, honesty and transparency are paramount, especially when identifying limitations or potential areas for improvement in the software.
